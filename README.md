**Day Twenty - 30 days of React challenge - "Task Manager" app**

Chores are assigned to different users, drag and delete once the chore is complete.

**Concepts Explored:**

- The importance of PRE PLANNING your app!
- Importance of careful structure of data

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
